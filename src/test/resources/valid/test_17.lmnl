[s}In the beginning of creation, when God made heaven and earth, 
 the earth was without form and void, with darkness over the face of 
 the abyss, and a mighty wind that swept over the surface of the waters.{s] 
[v}God said, "Let there be a light," and there was light;{v] 
[v}and God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from darkness.{v] 
[v}[s}He called the light day, and the darkness night. So evening came, and 
 morning came, the first day.{s]{v]
